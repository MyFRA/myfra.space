When I was working, I often need to transfer files from my computer to my phone, my phone to my computer or to other devices. I usually rely on traditional way such as using a data cable or I send the file via whatsapp and then download it on the receiving device

However using that method, I started to feel that this approach is not effective. I need either data cable or mobile data just to transfer file, even though all of my devices are allready connected to the same local network

By transferring files over the same network, we no longer need data cable or mobile data. The transferring files become wireless and more flexible. Thats why I started using an app called **LocalSend** for simplify us to transferring files and I want to share how to transfer files over local network using **Localsend**

## Installation

- **Arch**: `yay -S localsend-bin`
